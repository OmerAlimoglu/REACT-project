[full description will be added later]

## Demo

Online deployment of this project is available here: "I'll add the demo link here after I finished the project. "


## The project structure

The structure will be updated during the project.

```
## Setup

I'm thinking to add setup info..

 

## MUST-HAVE
1. Create the project structure
2. Create a search bar according to place, date and number of persons.
3. Create a navbar at the top.
4. Create a register and log in buttons.
5. Create a home page.
6. Create a result page.
7. Create a single hotel description page
8. Add the ability to adding the price and display the sum.
9. Create your own backend. 
10. Use mongodb as your database and fetch the data from there.
11. Prepare the repository

## NICE-TO-HAVE
- a new page for register and login. 
- add a sidebar for searching in order to change the search preferences in the result page.
- unable to reselect the same hotel on the same date during the selection process.
- add a feature to the single hotel room page to see the room pictures like a gallery.
